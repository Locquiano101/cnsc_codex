Tier 1: Complex System Overhauls (Hardest)
Dashboard & Tracking System

    Make dashboard the default landing page after login.

    Implement accomplishment tracking (percentage/status bars).

    Add submission/document tracking with audit logs.

    Pie-chart visualization for approvals (color-coded: grey = pending, colored = approved).

    Accreditation & Evaluation Engine

    APESOC Ratings System (automated scoring based on criteria).

    Dynamic scoring breakdown (PPA, Awards, Meetings, etc.).

    Evaluator roles/permissions (Sou Head, Student Trustee, OSSD Director).

    Registration & Org Management

    Organization categorization (Academic, Lifestyle, Fraternity, etc.).

    Adviser academic rank integration.

    Specialization tagging for filtering.

    Revision Workflow

    Visibility of comments during revisions.

    "PENDING" lockout (restrict access to other pages until revisions are approved).

Tier 2: Core Feature Upgrades (Moderate)
UI/UX Improvements

    Redesign CODEX logo (white outline, larger text, better alignment).

    Confirmation modals for all critical actions (e.g., submissions, edits).

    Filtering & Monitoring

    Filter by category (org type, status, specialization).

    Organization monitoring dashboard (visualizations, summaries).

    Anti-Duplication & Restrictions

    Constraints for repeating processes/events.

    Prevent duplicate submissions (e.g., same event logged twice).

    Logging & Security

    Action/update logs (timestamped, user-specific).

Tier 3: Quick Wins (Easiest)
Static Content & Labels

    Summary pages (Accredited Orgs, APESOC Results).

    Clarify points breakdown in accreditation requirements.

    Basic Validation

    Logo approval disclaimer ("Not approved by SDU").

Tooltips/help text for unclear fields.
